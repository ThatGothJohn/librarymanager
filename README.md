# librarymanager
A Python script designed to automatically rename and edit the metadata of large media libraries, allowing for easier management of your movies and tv shows

## Current limitations
* only does tv shows
* Expects media files to be in folders named the correct TV show's name
* Doesn't remove the old media after renaming and changing the metadata
* expects all media folders to be in the directory above the librarymanager directory 
* Doesn't support nested directories
* Doesn't support any seasons other than the first of any TV show
